# KubeMod Test Core (KMTC) Unified Testing Framework

[cite_start]The KubeMod Test Core (KMTC) is an open-source Python-based framework that provides shared testing infrastructure and utilities for performance and chaos testing across a diverse set of Kubernetes-based products.

## Project Status

This is an official **Red Hat Project**. The content and code in this repository are owned by Red Hat, Inc.

## Core Principle

[cite_start]The core principle of this framework is to separate concerns between this reusable, open-source infrastructure repository and distinct, self-contained product testing repositories. [cite_start]The KMTC repository provides shared core logic and utilities, while product repositories contain all tests and configurations for a single product, declaring this framework as a dependency.

## Getting Started
